      <p>National Grid Electricity System Operator (ESO), in partnership with Environmental Defense Fund Europe and WWF, has developed a series of Regional Carbon Intensity forecasts for the GB electricity system, with weather data provided by the Met Office.</p>
      <p>The map below shows the carbon intensity of electricity across Great Britain in real-time, connecting us to the elements that power our world.</p>
      <p>Carbon intensity measures how much carbon dioxide (CO2) is released when producing electricity. Lower values mean cleaner energy with fewer emissions.</p>
      <p>The map uses live National Grid data to display how &apos;clean&apos; or &apos;dirty&apos; electricity is in different regions:</p>
      <ul className="ms-3 ms-sm-4 ms-md-5">
        <li>üî• Fire: Fossil fuels like coal and gas have high carbon intensity</li>
        <li>üí® Air: Wind power has very low carbon intensity</li>
        <li>‚òÄÔ∏è Sun: Solar energy has very low carbon intensity</li>
        <li>üíß Water: Hydroelectric power has very low carbon intensity</li>
      </ul>
      <p className="mb-4">Colors on the map represent different levels of carbon intensity, measured in grams of CO2 per kilowatt-hour (gCO2/kWh).</p>
